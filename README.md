# Brightsite Portfolio

This is a portfolio website for Brightsite.

This repo is used to hold GSAP code for the portfolio website, and hopefully some other cool stuff related to 3D and WebGL.

## GSAP

GSAP is a JavaScript library for creating high-performance animations. It is used to create smooth and fluid animations for the portfolio website.

## 3D and WebGL

3D and WebGL are used to create the 3D animations for the portfolio website.

## Happy Exploring!
